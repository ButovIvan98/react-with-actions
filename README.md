## Introduction

At [Pindo](https://www.pindo.io/), recently we automated all our deployment processes by setting up a continuous development pipeline for our repositories. The automation approach reduces the number of errors that would otherwise occur because of the repetitive steps of Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Development (CD).

In this tutorial, you will learn how to set up continuous integration and continuous deployment of a React app using tools like [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). We will use an Ubuntu (18.04 LTS) droplet on [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) to host our app.


## Prerequisites

Here are the prerequisites required for this tutorial. 
- A Github account [Github](https://github.com/)
- A [Docker Droplet](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/docker) (Ubuntu 18.04 LTS) on DigitalOcean. Sign up with my [Referral Link](https://m.do.co/c/3823fc9590b7) and get $100 in credit for over 60 days.

## Create your app

Use the officially supported [create-react-app.dev](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/) to create a single-page React application. It offers a modern build setup with no configuration.

- Install create-react-app
```bash
npm install -g create-react-app
```
- Quick Start
```bash
npx create-react-app my-app && cd my-app
npm start
```

## Dockerize your app.
Add a Dockerfile to the project root:
```docker
FROM node:13.1-alpine

WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN yarn cache clean && yarn --update-checksums
COPY . ./
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["yarn", "start"]

```
> `yarn cache clean` running this command will clear the global cache.
> `yarn --update-checksums` lock lockfile if there's a mismatch between them and their package's checksum.

Let's build and tag our docker image
```bash
docker build -t my-app:dev .
```
Run the container once the build is done
```bash
docker run -it -p 3000:3000 my-app:dev 
```

Boom ðŸ’¥! Our app is running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)
!['app-image'](https://pindo.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-02%20at%2021.45.05.png)

Let's create another Dockerfile-prod to the project root. You will use this file in production. 

*Dockerfile-prod:*
```docker
FROM node:13.1-alpine as build

WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN yarn cache clean && yarn --update-checksums
COPY . ./
RUN yarn && yarn build

# Stage - Production
FROM nginx:1.17-alpine
COPY --from=build /usr/src/app/build /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```
> In this *Dockerfile-prod* we create a production build for our app and then copy the build file to nginx html directory.

Next, let's build and run our production image.
```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile-prod -t my-app:prod .
```
```bash
docker run -itd -p 80:80 --rm my-app:prod
```
> Our app is now running on port 80. In the next segment, we will publish the image to Github Packages.


## Publish Your Image to Github Packages.

[Github Packages](https://github.com/features/packages) gives you the option to publish and consume packages within your business or worldwide. To realize this, we will create a Github Action which will publish our package to the Github Packages Registry. Before we deploy our production image to the registry, we need to make sure that our code is production-ready. 

### deploy.yml

Let's create our first Continuous Integration (CI) action in our project.
```bash
mkdir .github && cd .github && mkdir workflows && cd workflows && touch deploy.yml
``` 
> The command above creates a workflow folder and a `deploy.yml` file. You can replace `yarn` with `npm` in the code below.

```yaml
  
name: CI & CD

on:
  push:
    branches: 
      - master

jobs:

```
> Note that Github Actions automatically provides you with GITHUB_TOKEN secrets. 

### Github Repository and Remote Origins

![Alt. repo](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/7cy6xeat508b5e7nhct3.png)

**Add Remote origins to our repository**
![Alt remote-origin](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/qjj2wi2ogk2jfzihu58i.png)

**Add repository secrets**
What are [Secrets](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets)? They are encrypted environment variables that you create in a repository for use with GitHub Actions.

Next, let's add our `GITHUB_USERNAME` to the secrets. 
> Remember that GITHUB provides you with `GITHUB_TOKEN` by default.

![Alt Secrets](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/v02d6fbuhavi6ilyfjv8.jpeg)

**Push to master**
Let's recap. We completed setting up our secrets, created our remote repository, and set remote origins to our local repository. We are now ready to go ahead and push our changes to our remote repository. 

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push origin master
```

If you click on actions, you will notice the start of the deployment workflow. Wait and see your image being published on your Github Packages Registry.

![Alt actions](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/u44quiqpbfzd3btnvj5s.jpeg)

Let's look at our package now.

You can also find your docker image package in your repository.

We successfully published our docker app image on the Github Package Registry. We are going to order a Docker Droplet on DigitalOcean and set up a flow to deploy and our app image on DigitalOcean.

## Deploy.

For deployment, we are going to create a [Docker Droplet](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/docker) on DigitalOcean. Please do not forget to sign up with my [Referral Link](https://m.do.co/c/3823fc9590b7) and get $100 in credit for over 60 days.

![Alt docker-droplet](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/s3ksr4go646y3e4389v3.png)

For this example, we access our droplet with a username and a password, please choose a one-time password over an SSH key.

![Alt one-t-p](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/95ph8r6gu9zv6kc8m27l.png)

After configuring and resetting your droplet password let's now add your droplet secrets to your repository.
- HOST: Droplet IP_ADDRESS
- PASSWORD: Droplet PASSWORD
- PORT: Droplet SSH port (22)
- USERNAME: Droplet USERNAME

![Alt secrets-do](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/cerjcwho6vf2wp45bfsi.png)


### Update deploy.yml file. 

You have succeeded in setting up your droplet secrets to your repository. You will now add another code block to deploy your package and run it in our droplet using [ssh-action](https://github.com/appleboy/ssh-action). It's GitHub Actions for executing remote ssh commands.

```yaml
name: CI & CD

on:
  push:
    branches: 
      - master

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v1
    - name: Use Node.js 13.10
      uses: actions/setup-node@v1
      with:
        node-version: '13.10'
    - name: Install yarn and run unittest
      run: |
        yarn
        yarn test
      env:
        CI: true
    - name: Publish to Github Packages Registry
      uses: elgohr/Publish-Docker-Github-Action@master
      with:
        name: my_github_username/my_repository_name/my_image_name
        registry: docker.pkg.github.com
        username: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_USERNAME }}
        password: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        dockerfile: Dockerfile-prod
        tags: latest
    - name: Deploy package to digitalocean
      uses: appleboy/ssh-action@master
      env:
          GITHUB_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_USERNAME }}
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      with:
        host: ${{ secrets.HOST }}
        username: ${{ secrets.USERNAME }}
        password: ${{ secrets.PASSWORD }}
        port: ${{ secrets.PORT }}
        envs: GITHUB_USERNAME, GITHUB_TOKEN
        script: |
          docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)
          docker login docker.pkg.github.com -u $GITHUB_USERNAME -p $GITHUB_TOKEN
          docker run -dit -p 80:80 docker.pkg.github.com/my_github_username/my_repository_name/my_image_name:latest
```
> We previously published the app image to the Github Package Registry by signing in with the Github Credentials (GITHUB_USERNAME and GITHUB_TOKEN ). To pull the image from the registry we must login to archive so.  

Let's commit and push our changes to master.

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "deploy to digitalocean"
git push origin master
```

We're using the ssh-action to remotely access our droplet from our repository.
- `docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)` stops all the previous running containers.
- `docker run -dit -p 80:80 my_github_username/my_repository_name/my_image_name:tag` pull the lastest image and run it on port 80. 

As you can see bellow the workflow is passing.

Congratulations ðŸŽ‰! You can now access your react-app on your droplet IP_ADDRESS or DOMAIN_NAME.

Mine is running on [http://167.172.51.225/](http://167.172.51.225/)
